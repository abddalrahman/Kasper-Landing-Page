# Kasper Landing Page

A detailed and responsive one-page website built using HTML and CSS. This project was created on **November 3, 2023** as a follow-up to my first UI experiment, with a stronger focus on layout structure, content hierarchy, and visual clarity.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This project was built by following a YouTube tutorial. The design and structure are not original, but the implementation was done entirely by me as a hands-on exercise to deepen my understanding of semantic HTML, layout systems, and responsive behavior.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
  - Flexbox
  - CSS Grid
  - Media Queries for responsiveness

## 📐 Page Sections

- **Services** – Overview of services
- **Portfolio** – Showcase of sample work
- **About** – Brief introduction and philosophy
- **Pricing** – Structured plans
- **Contact** – Form and address

## 🎯 Purpose

This project served as a deeper dive into front-end layout architecture. Compared to my first landing page, Kasper includes more content sections, refined spacing, and a clearer visual rhythm. It helped me practice modular CSS and responsive design techniques in a real-world layout.
